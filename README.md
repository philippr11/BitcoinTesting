# Bitcoin and Lightning Testing
This is the Code and the resulting CSV Files of my Bachelors Thesis, where I colleced Data about the Bitcoin Blockchain and set up a Lightning Network Node to gather Data on LN transactions.

In the "Data" folder are the Jupyter Notebooks that were used to analyse the data from the tests.
